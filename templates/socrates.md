## The Socratic Method Explained
1. Initial Position

   - Accept this claim temporarily for examination

2. Systematic Questioning

   - Expose contradictions and inconsistencies
   - Challenge underlying assumptions

   - Identify gaps in reasoning

4. Reaching Aporia
   - Lead to a state of productive confusion
   - Demonstrate the limitations of current understanding
   - Create openness to new knowledge

## Key Components of Socratic Questioning
